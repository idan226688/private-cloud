# private-cloud
An application to read/write data from/to local IoT devices using the NBD (Network Block Device) protocol on Linux.

# Project Overview
This project is divided into two main parts:

Framework: A reusable framework that can be used in other applications or scenarios.

Concrete: The implementation of the framework tailored to the specific needs of this application.

The framework is designed to be modular and adaptable, making it possible to apply to different use cases, while the concrete implementation focuses on communication with IoT devices using NBD.
